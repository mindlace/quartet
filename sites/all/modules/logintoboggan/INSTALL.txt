    INSTALL.txt for logintoboggan.module for Drupal
*******************************************************

INSTALLATION:

Place entire loggintoboggan module folder into
  (a) your sites/all/modules directory
  (b) your sites/[my site]/modules directory.

Enable the module at 
Administer -> Site building - > Modules

Configure loggintoboggan settings at 
Administer -> User management -> LoginToboggan.

The module changes the functionality of the login block 
AND provides a new 'LoginToboggan logged in block' 

Configure each block at
Administer -> Site building -> Blocks
as follows...

1. Configure the 'User login' block for LoginToboggan functionality:

Change title if required; using <none> can make for a very neat login system,
when combined with the javascript functionality: clicking upon "Login/register"
reveals the login form in neat sliding fashion. To select this functionality,
select 'Collapsible form' under "Block type".  Selecting 'Link' under "Block
type" sends user to a login form, returning them to original page after
successful login.

2. Configure 'LoginToboggan logged in block' 

Tip: by leaving the title blank, the 'LoginToboggan logged in block' is slim
and neat.

Done!
